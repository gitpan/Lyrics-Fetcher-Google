NAME
    Lyrics::Fetcher::Google - Get some lyrics. Maybe.

SYNOPSIS
      use Lyrics::Fetcher;

      $Lyrics::Fetcher::gid = '<your google API id>';

      print Lyrics::Fetcher->fetch("<artist>","<song>","Google");

DESCRIPTION
    This module tries to find lyrics on the web. Sometimes it works. But it
    probably won't.

    It searches google for an initial set. It then finds the largest block
    of plain text in the top 5 results. Those results are then compared to
    one another and weighted. The idea being that a large block of text on
    one site may be a bunch of poo, but a large area of similar text on
    multiple sites most likely is the lyrics for which you are looking.

BUGS
    Yes. I would be happy to hear that this worked for someone. Let me know
    if it does. I may even respond if you let me know that it doesn't.
